# OpenAI Realtime API

OpenAI [Realtime API](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-realtime-api/) WIP client. Currently only tested a happy path (voice chat, see https://github.com/yawn/oairt/blob/main/example/audio.go). PRs welcome.

Wherever noted in the [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events) (or somewhat obvious), optional values are references.
